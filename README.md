# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
This repository contains code for performing customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm on a mall customer dataset. The aim of the project is to better understand the different types of customers in the dataset and gain insights into their behavior and preferences.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Mall_Customers.csv file, which can be found in the data directory. The dataset contains information on customers of a mall, including their gender, age, annual income, and spending score.

## Usage
To run the code in this repository, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

*pandas
*numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sklearn
Once you have installed these libraries, you can run the customer_segmentation.ipynb notebook to perform customer segmentation using K-Means clustering.

## Tasks
The project consists of the following tasks:

1. Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
2. Prepare the data for clustering
3. Implement K-Means clustering
4. Visualize and analyze the clusters
5. Write a report summarizing the findings
## Credits
The project was completed as part of the MSBA program at the Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle.
